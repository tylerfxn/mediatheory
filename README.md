## A media [re]mixing interface - üíæ üé∞ üéûÔ∏è

`mediatheory` is an open source toolkit for producing art: dicing, slicing, chopping, and remixing media. It accomplishes this by:

- providing a hands-on command line and programmatic interface to media transformation
- integrating generative AI APIs across image and video, like [`runway`](https://docs.dev.runwayml.com/) / [`luma`](https://lumalabs.ai/luma-api/client-docs/index.html) / [`fal`](https://fal.ai/) / [`replicate`](https://replicate.com/) / [`flux`](https://blackforestlabs.ai/), and more.
- leveraging multimedia transformation softwares like
    - [`FFmpeg`](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) - process multimedia content such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.
    - [`ImageMagick`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) - for editing and manipulating digital images.
    - [`SoX`](https://github.com/chirlu/sox) - Swiss Army knife of sound processing.
    - [`gstreamer`](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer) - a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. 
    - [`MLT Framework`](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt) - multimedia framework designed for video editing.
    - [`OpenCV`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) - a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.
    - and more.

## Important Reading

*Media are all the interfaces between consciousness and reality, transforming both the message and the messenger. Media are any extension of human capability that shapes how we perceive, process, and project our world.*

*Media is the substrate through which human intention becomes sensory experience, encompassing all technologies that extend our ability to create, communicate, and comprehend.*

*Media is everything and everything is media.*
